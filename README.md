This Android application is a simple True or False quiz app that focuses on South African history. It is developed using Kotlin and is designed to help users test their knowledge on key historical facts. The quiz offers an engaging and educational experience, ideal for students or anyone interested in learning more about South Africa’s past.
The app features four pre-defined true or false questions. As the user interacts with the app, they are presented with one question at a time. The user responds by selecting either the "True" or "False" button. Immediate feedback is provided through toast messages-either "Correct!" for right answers or "Wrong!" for incorrect ones. The app keeps track of the user's score and also logs any questions that were answered incorrectly for later review.
After the user has responded to all the questions, the app transitions to a third screen—the Score Screen—where the total score is displayed along with a list of the questions that were answered incorrectly. This helps reinforce learning by giving the user an opportunity to review and reflect on the mistakes made during the quiz.
The application consists of two main Kotlin files: MainActivity.kt, which manages the quiz logic and user interaction, and ScoreScreen.kt, which displays the final results. The corresponding layout files—activity_questionscreen.xml and activity_scorescreen.xml—define the user interface for each screen.
